## Overview

The backend of MovieVerse is built using the **microservices architecture**. This architecture allows for independent scalability and enhanced flexibility in the development of different functionalities of the app, such as authentication, user management, movie data processing, and more.

**Important**: Be sure to carefully read this file and the [README.md](databases/README.md) file in the `databases` directory for more information on the backend services of MovieVerse before you start developing.

## Architecture

The microservices architecture of MovieVerse is designed to segregate the application into small, loosely coupled services. Each service is focused on a single business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

- **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **User Service**: Handles user-related operations like profile management.
- **Movie Service**: Manages movie data and interactions.
- **Machine Learning Service**: Provides AI functionalities for movie data processing.
- **Crawler Service**: Dynamically updates the database with new movie data from various online sources.
- **Review Service**: Handles user reviews and ratings.
- **Recommendation Service**: Provides movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history.
- **Search Service**: Offers comprehensive search functionality for movies and users.
- **And so many more...**

```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/The-MovieVerse-Database.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the repository: 
   ```bash
   cd MovieVerse-Backend
   ```
   
3. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
   
4. Follow the specific installation instructions for each service below.

### Quick Start

To quickly start the backend services of MovieVerse, simply run:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start most (but not all) of the services required for the backend of MovieVerse. Note that before running this command, you must have all the prerequisites installed on your machine.

**Important**: Remember to set the `SECRET_KEY` and set `Debug` to `True` in the [settings.py](django_backend/django_backend/settings.py) file in the `django_backend` directory. This is crucial for running the Django server locally. Additionally, you are also required to obtain a Django secret key and set it in the `settings.py` file.

### Running the Services (Recommended)

To run the MovieVerse's backend services, follow these steps **in order**:

#### Database Services

MovieVerse currently uses MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, and MySQL as its primary databases, as well as RabbitMQ as its primary message broker. To run these databases, execute the following commands:

1. Ensure that MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and MySQL are installed on your machine and are running. For example, on MacOS and if you are using `Homebrew`, you can run the following commands:

    ```bash
    brew services start mongodb
    brew services start rabbitmq
    brew services start mysql
    brew services start postgresql
    redis-server
    ```
    Also, before you continue, ensure that the MySQL database `MovieVerse` is running and exists. If not, open the MySQL client using the following command:

    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p
    ```
   
    Then, enter your password and run the following command to create the database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE MovieVerse;
    LIST DATABASES;
    ```
   
    You should see the `MovieVerse` database in the list of databases.

    Also, for your PostgreSQL database, ensure that the database `MovieVerse` is running and exists. If not, open the PostgreSQL client using the following command:

    ```bash
    psql -U root -d <your_database_name>
    ```
   
    Replace `<your_database_name>` with the name of your database - the one you created when you installed PostgreSQL.
   
    Then, run the following command to create the database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE MovieVerse;
    ```
   
2. Run the scripts inside the `databases` directory to create the necessary databases and tables:

    ```bash
    cd databases
    node app.js
    ```
   
3. If the script runs successfully, you should see the following output in your terminal:

    ```bash
    Server running on port 9090
    Visit http://localhost:9090/ to test the connection.
    Connected to MongoDB database 1: MovieVerse
    Connected to MongoDB database 2: MovieVerse_movies
    Connected to MongoDB database 3: MovieVerse_users
    Connected to MongoDB database 4: MovieVerse_reviews
    Connected to MongoDB database 5: MovieVerse_people
    Connected to MongoDB database 6: MovieVerse_genres
    Redis Connected
    Connected to PostgreSQL
    Connected to MySQL
    Redis Test: Hello from Redis
    PostgreSQL Test: 2024-06-18T16:53:56.494Z
    RabbitMQ Connected
    [*] Waiting for messages in task_queue. To exit press CTRL+C
    ```
   
    This output confirms that you have successfully connected to all the databases required for the backend services of MovieVerse. Now you can start developing and testing the services!
   
4. Test the RabbitMQ functionality by sending a message to the queue:

    ```bash
    node publish.js
    ```
   
5. If the message is successfully sent, you should see the following output in your terminal:

    ```bash
    [x] Received Hello from RabbitMQ
    ```
   
6. You can also go to `http://localhost:9090/` in your browser to test the connection to the databases. If the connection is successful, you should see the following output:

    ```
    Congratulations! MovieVerse server is running! MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis connections have been established.
    ```

    This confirms that you have successfully connected to all the databases required for the backend services of MovieVerse.

7. For the next steps, refer to the [README.md](databases/README.md) file in the `databases` directory for more information on the database services.
   
**Disclaimer**: These servers are for your local development environment only, in order for you to see how our backend services interact with each other.
In our production environment, we use cloud-based services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud (in our case, **Heroku**) to host our databases and services. This thus will look different from what you might see on your end.
   
#### Django Service

The Django service is responsible for handling the majority of backend functionalities of MovieVerse, such as API endpoints, movies management, database interactions, user management, and more. It was designed using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture. To run the Django service, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `django_backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd django_backend
    ```
   
2. Make the necessary migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
   
3. Run the Django Service:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
NOTE: Before running the Django server, be sure to set the `DEBUG` variable to `True` in the `settings.py` file. This is crucial for running the server locally. Additionally, you are also required to obtain a Django secret key and set it in the `settings.py` file. For security reasons, we have hidden the secret key in the `.env` file. Please [contact me](mailto:info@movie-verse.com) for access to the secret key.

```python
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
Debug = True
```

If your installation and run are successful, you should see the following output in your terminal:

```bash
Watching for file changes with StatReloader

Django version 3.2, using settings 'django_backend.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
[17/Jun/2024 08:39:00] "GET /search/?search=g HTTP/1.1" 200 2693
```

If you go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser, you should see te following admin interface for the backend of MovieVerse:

<p align="center" style="cursor: pointer">
    <img src="../images/Administration-UI.png" alt="The MovieVerse Backend Admin Interface" width="100%" height="auto" style="border-radius: 10px"/>
</p>

This is the Django admin interface for the backend of MovieVerse. It allows you (the admin and other authorized users) to manage users, movies, reviews, and more in the databases. 

For example, if you click on `Movies`, you should see the following interface, which allows you to manage movies in the database:

<p align="center" style="cursor: pointer">
    <img src="../images/Movies-UI.png" alt="The MovieVerse Movies Interface" width="100%" height="auto" style="border-radius: 10px"/>
</p>

Note that the UI that you see when you go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser is only a template and does not represent the actual UI of the MovieVerse app. The actual UI is built using React and Vue and can be found in the [MovieVerse-Frontend](../MovieVerse-Frontend) directory.

**Important**: There has been a known Django bug where the admin interface' CSS styles are not loaded properly. If you encounter this issue, you can fix it by:

1. Set the `STATIC_ROOT` variable in the `settings.py` file to the path of the `static` directory in the `django_backend` directory:

    ```python
    import os
    
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
    ```

2. Set the `STATIC_URL` variable in the `settings.py` file to the path of the `static` directory in the `django_backend` directory:

    ```python
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    ```
   
3. Run the following command to collect the static files:

    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

If the issue is still not fixed, contact me at [info@movie-verse.com](mailto:info@movie-verse.com) so that I can take a look at your situation.
