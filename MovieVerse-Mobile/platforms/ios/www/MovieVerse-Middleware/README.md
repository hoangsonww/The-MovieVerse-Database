# The MovieVerse - `MovieVerse-Middleware` Directory

## Overview

Welcome to the `MovieVerse-Middleware` directory of the MovieVerse project! This directory contains crucial middleware components that handle various aspects of the MovieVerse application. These components include authentication, logging, error handling, and data processing for the application's backend.

## Directory Contents

The Middleware directory consists of two primary files:

1. **middleware.js**
2. **app-middleware.py**

### middleware.js

This JavaScript file is built on the Node.js platform using the Express framework. It includes several middleware functions essential for the backend operations of the MovieVerse application.

#### Key Features:

- **Logger Middleware**: Logs every request to the server, including the request method, URL, and timestamp.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Verifies JWT tokens in request headers to authenticate users.
- **Movie Fetcher Middleware**: Retrieves movie details based on the provided movie ID.
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Catches and handles errors occurring during request processing.
- **Movie Data Validation Middleware**: Ensures that all required movie data fields are present in the request.
- **Route-specific Middleware Application**: Demonstrates how to apply middleware to specific routes, such as the route for adding new movies.

#### Usage:

To use this middleware in your Node.js application, include it in your server file and apply it to your Express app instance as shown in the file.

### app-middleware.py

This Python file is created with Flask, a micro web framework. It includes custom middleware implementations suitable for a Flask application.

#### Key Features:

- **Logger Middleware**: A custom middleware that logs details about each request and its response time.
- **Custom Request Processing Middleware**: Inspects incoming requests, logging method, path, content length, type, body, and headers.
- **Custom Response Modification Middleware**: Processes responses after they are generated, providing information about the response status, headers, body, and processing time.
- **Error and Exception Handling Middleware**: Handles specific HTTP errors (e.g., 404 not found) and general exceptions, returning JSON responses.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Demonstrates how to handle routes with POST and GET methods, including a placeholder for authentication logic.

#### Usage:

To integrate this middleware into a Flask application, include it in your Flask server file. The middleware will automatically apply to all routes defined in the Flask app.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Ensure you have the MovieVerse project repository cloned.
2. **Navigate to the Middleware Directory**: Change your working directory to the Middleware directory within the project.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary dependencies for Node.js (`npm install`) and Flask (`pip install flask`).
4. **Integrate with Your Application**: Import these middleware modules into your main application server file and apply them as needed.
