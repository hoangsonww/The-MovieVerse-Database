## Overview

The `Machine-Learning` directory contains Python scripts that leverage machine learning techniques to provide various functionalities, such as genre classification, movie recommendations, sentiment analysis, and more. These scripts are integral to providing a personalized and interactive experience to the users of the MovieVerse app.

### Genre Classifier (`genre-classifier.py`)

This script uses machine learning models to classify movies into genres based on their descriptions, titles, and other metadata. It helps in categorizing movies accurately within the app database.

### Movie Recommendation (`movie-recommendation.py`)

This script is responsible for generating movie recommendations for users based on their viewing history, preferences, and ratings. It uses collaborative filtering and content-based methods to provide personalized recommendations.

### Movie Reviews Analysis (`movie-reviews.py`)

This script processes and analyzes movie reviews, extracting insights and useful information. It might use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user sentiments, key themes, and overall opinions about movies.

### Plot Summarizer (`plot-summarizer.py`)

`plot-summarizer.py` utilizes NLP and text summarization algorithms to create concise summaries of movie plots. This assists users in quickly grasping the essence of a movie without spoilers.

### Sentiment Analysis (`sentiment_analysis.py`)

This script performs sentiment analysis on user reviews and comments. It determines the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in the text, helping in gauging audience reception of movies.

## Using these Scripts

To run these scripts:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install necessary libraries using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming a `requirements.txt` file is present).
3. Execute each script as needed, e.g., `python genre-classifier.py`.

## Customization and Adaptation

These scripts can be modified or extended to suit specific needs or to integrate with new datasets. They can also be adapted to improve performance, accuracy, or to include additional machine learning models.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, tensorflow, keras, etc. (as required by each script)
