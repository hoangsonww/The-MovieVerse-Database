- **Cookies and Sessions**: Sessions are managed securely. Cookies, if used, are encrypted and do not store sensitive information.

### 2. Secure Communication
- **HTTPS**: The MovieVerse enforces HTTPS to ensure secure communication over the internet, encrypting data in transit.

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Form Inputs**: All inputs from forms are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other forms of data tampering.
- **API Requests**: Inputs via API requests are also validated and sanitized.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth2**: For user authentication, The MovieVerse implements OAuth2 protocol, ensuring secure authorization.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different levels of access are enforced depending on the user's role to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### 5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection
- **Content Security Policy**: The application implements Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Output Encoding**: Data output to the browser is encoded to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

### 6. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

### 8. Secure File Uploads
- **File Type Restrictions**: Only specific file types are allowed for upload to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
- **File Scanning**: Uploaded files are scanned for malware.

### 9. Error Handling and Logging
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented to prevent leakage of sensitive information through error messages.
- **Logging**: System activities are logged for monitoring and auditing purposes. Logs do not contain sensitive user data.

### 10. Dependency and Library Management
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and libraries are regularly updated to their latest secure versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans are conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

### 11. Infrastructure Security
