## Project Structure

The MovieVerse is a full-stack application with a robust backend and a user-friendly frontend. The project is divided into the following **3 main** directories:
1. `MovieVerse-Backend`: The [backend directory](../MovieVerse-Backend) contains the server-side code, including the API, database, and server configuration.
2. `MovieVerse-Frontend`: The [frontend directory](../MovieVerse-Frontend) contains the client-side code, including the user interface, user experience, and client configuration.
3. `MovieVerse-Mobile`: The [mobile app directory](../MovieVerse-Mobile) contains the mobile application code, built using Apache Cordova, including the mobile user interface, user experience, and mobile client configuration.

There are also additional directories and files for project configuration, testing, and other utilities. The project is built using a variety of technologies, including `.github`, `utilities`, `project-config`, `MovieVerse-APIs`, `MovieVerse-Databases`, `MovieVerse-Middleware`, `MovieVerse-Design`, `images`, and more. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the development, deployment, and maintenance of The MovieVerse application.

## Deployment

The current deployment and production branch is `deployment-branch` and is being deployed to the official website at [movie-verse.com](https://movie-verse.com). The deployment process involves building the frontend, backend, and mobile app, configuring the server, and deploying the application to the server. The deployment process is automated using CI/CD pipelines and scripts to ensure a seamless deployment experience.

The app is using `Netlify` for the frontend deployment and `Heroku` for the backend deployment. The deployment status is monitored regularly to ensure the application is up and running smoothly.
