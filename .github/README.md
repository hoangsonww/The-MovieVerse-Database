## Project Structure

The MovieVerse is a full-stack application with a robust backend and a user-friendly frontend. The project is divided into the following **3 main** directories:

1. `MovieVerse-Backend`: The [backend directory](../MovieVerse-Backend) contains the server-side code, including the API, database, and server configuration.
2. `MovieVerse-Frontend`: The [frontend directory](../MovieVerse-Frontend) contains the client-side code, including the user interface, user experience, and client configuration.
3. `MovieVerse-Mobile`: The [mobile app directory](../MovieVerse-Mobile) contains the mobile application code, built using Apache Cordova, including the mobile user interface, user experience, and mobile client configuration.

There are also additional directories and files for project configuration, testing, and other utilities. The project is built using a variety of directories, including `.github`, `MovieVerse-Utilities`, `MovieVerse-Config`, `MovieVerse-Middleware`, `MovieVerse-Design`, `images`, and more. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the development, deployment, and maintenance of The MovieVerse application.

## Deployment

The current deployment and production branch is the [main-deployment-branch](https://github.com/hoangsonww/The-MovieVerse-Database/tree/main-deployment-branch) and is being deployed to the official website at [movie-verse.com](https://movie-verse.com). The deployment process involves building the frontend, backend, and mobile app, configuring the server, and deploying the application to the server. The deployment process is automated using CI/CD pipelines and scripts to ensure a seamless deployment experience.

The app is using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the frontend deployment and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) for the backend deployment. The deployment status is monitored regularly to ensure the application is up and running smoothly.

## Getting Started

To get started with The MovieVerse, follow these _very simple_ steps:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Install Emscripten and compile the C code to WebAssembly (refer to the README.md file in the `utilities` directory [here](../MovieVerse-Utilities/README.md).)
4. Take a look at the project configuration directory (project-config) and make sure that the paths are correct.
5. Visit the root directory and install the dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
6. Visit the backend directory and install the dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    cd MovieVerse-Backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
7. Start the backend servers and services (refer to the [README.md](../MovieVerse-Backend/README.md) file in the `MovieVerse-Backend` directory for more information). 
Or, for your convenience, you may simply run the following command, provided that you already have MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ running on your system:
    ```bash
    npm run backend
    ```
8. Return to the **root** directory and start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   This will start the deployment server, including the frontend, so you can start developing and testing your changes right away. If you make any changes, be sure to reload the web page to see the updates.
9. **If you would also like to develop the mobile app versions:** Visit the mobile app directory and install the dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    cd MovieVerse-Mobile
    npm install
    cordova platform add ios
    cordova platform add android
    ```
10. Start the mobile app using Cordova (visit the `MovieVerse-Mobile` directory for more information):
    ```bash
    cordova build
    cordova emulate ios
    cordova emulate android
    ```
11. If you'd also like to dockerize the application, you can run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run docker
    ```
    This will create a Docker image of the application, which you can then deploy to a containerized environment.
12. As you develop, be sure to save & commit your changes (and don't forget to create a branch for your new feature):
    ```bash
    git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'
    ```
13. Push to your branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
    ```
14. Open a Pull Request (if you want to merge your changes to our official app!)
15. Enjoy coding and [let me know](https://github.com/hoangsonww/The-MovieVerse-Database/discussions) if you have any questions!
