## CSS/SASS Style

## File Structure

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep your styles, components, and tests in separate files.
- **Naming Convention**: Use PascalCase for file names.
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports for files within the `src` folder.
- **Index Files**: Use index files to export multiple files from a folder.

## Code Quality

- **Linting**: Use ESLint to enforce code quality.
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier to format code.
- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- **Comments**: Write meaningful comments where necessary, especially for complex logic.

## Version Control

- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-movie-search`).
- **Commits**: Write clear, concise commit messages. Include the context and purpose of the change.
- **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for merging code into the main branch. Ensure PRs are reviewed before merging.
- **Merging**: Use the "Squash and Merge" option when merging pull requests.
- **Rebasing**: Use `git rebase` to keep your branch up to date with the main branch.
- **Commit History**: Keep your commit history clean and organized. Avoid unnecessary merge commits.

## Accessibility
