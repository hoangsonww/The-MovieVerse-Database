## Overview

The configuration files in this directory are crucial for setting up the development environment, ensuring code quality, and configuring deployment options. Each file serves a specific purpose and is explained in detail below.

### .babelrc

This JSON file contains the configurations for Babel, a JavaScript compiler used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version for older browsers. This file includes presets and plugins needed for the project.

### .env.example

A template for an `.env` file, which is used to store environment variables. This file includes placeholders for sensitive information like API keys or database URIs, which should be replaced by the user's specific details.

### .eslintrc.json

Configuration file for ESLint, a static code analysis tool used to identify problematic patterns in JavaScript code. This file defines the coding conventions and rules to be followed in the project.

### .npmrc

A configuration file for npm (Node Package Manager), which helps to manage the project's dependencies. This file can include settings like registry, scope, and access levels.

### .travis.yml

Configuration file for Travis CI, a continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted on GitHub. This file defines the build environment, scripts to run, and more.

### babel.config.json

Another Babel configuration file, which might be used to specify options for a wide range of Babel versions or specific project-wide configurations.

### docker-compose.yml

A YAML file used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. With this file, you can configure services, networks, and volumes for the Docker environment.

Configuration file for Nginx, a web server used to handle HTTP requests, redirect traffic, serve static files, and more. This file includes settings like server blocks, location blocks, and other directives.

### webpack.config.js

Configuration file for Webpack, a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. This file specifies how modules within the application are treated, including rules, plugins, entry and exit points, and more.

### .netlify Directory

This directory contains configuration files used by Netlify to deploy and manage The MovieVerse website. Below are the details of each file present in the `.netlify` directory. This serves as a **sample** for deploying your own instance of MovieVerse on Netlify. Refer to the [`.netlify` README](./.netlify/README.md) for more details.

## Using these Files

## Customization and Adaptation

These files are pre-configured for a standard setup but might require adjustments to fit specific project needs or environments. Always review and customize them according to your project requirements.

## Contributions

If you would like to contribute to the development or improvement of these configuration files, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the project's main documentation.
