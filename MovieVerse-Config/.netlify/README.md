# The MovieVerse - `.netlify` Directory

This directory contains configuration files used by Netlify to deploy and manage The MovieVerse website. Below are the details of each file present in the `.netlify` directory. This serves as a **sample** for deploying your own instance of MovieVerse on Netlify.

## Files

### `_redirects`

This file contains rules for redirecting requests on your site. It's a simple text file where each line represents a redirect rule. These rules allow you to redirect traffic from one URL to another, implement URL rewrites, or set up custom 404 pages.

#### Format

Each line in the `_redirects` file should follow this format:

```
/path/to/source /path/to/destination [status_code]
```

- `/path/to/source`: The path that you want to redirect from.
- `/path/to/destination`: The path where the traffic should be redirected to.
- `[status_code]`: (Optional) The HTTP status code for the redirect, such as `301` for permanent redirects or `302` for temporary redirects.

### `netlify.toml`

This file is used to configure your Netlify build and deploy settings in a structured format. The `netlify.toml` file allows you to specify various settings such as build commands, publish directory, environment variables, headers, redirects, and much more.

#### Structure

The `netlify.toml` file is organized into sections, represented by headers in square brackets (e.g., `[build]`, `[context.production]`). Each section contains key-value pairs that specify the configuration for that aspect of your Netlify deployment.

Example:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[context.production]
  environment = { NODE_ENV = "production" }
```

- `[build]`: Defines the build settings such as the build command and the directory to publish.
- `[context.production]`: Specifies settings that apply only to the production environment, like environment variables.

## Summary

The `.netlify` directory plays a crucial role in customizing how this (The MovieVerse) site is built and served on Netlify. The `_redirects` file provides powerful redirect capabilities, while the `netlify.toml` file offers comprehensive configuration options for building and deploying your site. Ensure that these files are correctly configured to take full advantage of Netlify's features for your project.
